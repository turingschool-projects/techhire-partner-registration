        %h2 MasterCard Case Study
        %p Mastercard began working with LaunchCode in the spring of 2014. Mastercard started with one apprentice developer. That developer got a job coming out of their apprenticeship. Growing out of the successful apprenticeship, Mastercard decided to start a larger pilot in the fall of 2014. At this time they took 3 additional apprentices in software engineering, project management, and development. One of these apprentices was LaShana Lewis, whose story of grit and hard work was later highlighted by President Obama.

        %p
          SAIC approached LaunchCode to help fill their talent needs. So far, it has been a great success. They have hired and converted three LaunchCode apprentices in the past year, including Lee Wissmiller, a US Marine veteran, who was diagnosed with narcolepsy ten years ago. Lee is a skilled programmer, but due to his disability, was unable to find a permanent job despite attending 285 job interviews. After discovering LaunchCode, Lee was placed at SAIC where he successfully transitioned to a full-time position as a software developer.
