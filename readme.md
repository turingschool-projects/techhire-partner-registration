# TechHire

This is a boilerplate Rails 4 app, used to develop the TechHire front-end. Feel free to use this repo to build the back-end functionality too.

The `Gemfile` lists the dependencies it needs for the front-end code and Rails (feel free to replace the default SQLite). This app currently uses Ruby `2.2.2`.

The front-end is a work in progress; at this point it's mostly scaffolding.

You can find links to all the mockups at [http://localhost:3000/mockups](http://localhost:3000/mockups). Please copy/paste this code to your own views and leave the mockup controller & views as they are.
